# ML_H20
Machine Learning Project on H20

H2O has made it easy for to experiment with machine learning, to produce high-performing machine learning models.It automates
the process of training a large selection of candidate models. H2Oâ€™s AutoML can also be a helpful tool for the advanced user, 
by providing a simple wrapper function that performs a large number of modeling-related tasks that would typically require many 
lines of code, and by freeing up their time to focus on other aspects of the data science pipeline tasks such as data-preprocessing,
feature engineering and model deployment.

I performed regression, binary clasification and multiclass clasification for the dataset and build the best model using AutoML
